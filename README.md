# Buena Pregunta

## What is this?

A bunch of people who used to have a band, we are not playing anymore (well, some of us are, and you might get some new stuff in the future) so this is a repository of finished/unfinished music we had, along with lyrics, logos and random stuff from back in the day when Buena Pregunta used to rock out every other week.

## Licensing

We have decided to license our stuff under a Creative Commons license, you might want to [check it for details](https://github.com/pote/Buena-Pregunta/blob/master/LICENSE.md).


## Thank you

We had a great run, got to play in a bunch of places for a bunch of people, and got free beer more often than not thanks to that, as well as a remarcable collection of great memories. We want to thank everyone who stood by us even in crappy performances, played our music here and there, pasted our stickers all over the place or simply said "hi" on the street because they recognized us from the stage. We are super glad we got to experience all this, it's been a wild run.

If you are feeling nostalgic, hop over to [grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com/#!/artist/Buena+Pregunta/1868281) where you can listen to some of our stuff for free, or go to [our facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Buena-Pregunta-/149975980337?fref=ts) and post whatever good story you have about the band (except from that time we wore cocktail dresses, don't talk about that).

Cheers everyone, rock on.
